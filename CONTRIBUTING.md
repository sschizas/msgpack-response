# Contribution

Before working on the project it's very important to understand its value and how it works. You can find that information in the project Documentation *(either in the README file or in the project Wiki)*. All my projects respect the [CODE OF CONDUCT](https://github.com/sschizas/msgpack-response/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Keep it present when contributing with the project. If any of the principles listed there is not followed I will be forced to take action on that.

## A note for developers

Are you interested in contributing? Just do it! My projects are also your projects. I created them for the community and you are part of that community. I am open to new contributors, proposals, improvements, bug fixes... If you are a very active contributor I will also add you as a member of the repository.

> I am looking forward to your contributions!

## Moderating

If you are moderator in any of our projects:

- When new Issues/PRs are opened we should check if they are in the scope of the project. In case they aren't we should politely explain why, suggesting alternatives, and closing them.
- To have a better organization we should tag the Issues/PRs as they get created. Include a label for the type and the severity & occurrence *(in case of a bug)*.
- If some information is required to have a better context about the Issue/PR we should ask the developer for it.
- If the Issue/PR doesn't follow the *Coe of Conduct*. We should close the Issue/PR right away.

## Issuing

If you are a developer using the project and you are interested in reporting an issue:

- The issue body will be automatically filled with a template. Fill the template information describing your issue and providing some context.
- Project moderators might ask you for for some information. Be willing to report it.
- Use a descriptive name for the Issue.
- The reported Issue must follow the *Code of Conduct*.

## Coding

If you contribute with the project make sure:

- Your changes in the project follow the project architecture and style.
- Make sure you include unit tests for your changes and they pass.
- Make sure you get all the GitHub validations passing.
- The code is documented.
- The CHANGELOG is updated to reflect the changes.
- If needed, the README includes a quick reference to the changes.
